					A heart that loves unconditionally no matter the pain that it has endured, showing affection and knowing the needs of others is the core value of Bleeding Hearts Inc. As we seek to encourage the disheartened and revitalize the weary. Bleeding Hearts Inc. is committed to continuously strive to foster an environment of forgiveness, tolerance and healing for all who desires it. In our community, empowerment and enrichment are held at the highest value.

						With an early beginning as a strong leader in her family it came naturally that she would transition so well into motherhood.  Shawina is the proud mother of four remarkable children; Kanii, Kaden, Kamiyah and Kennedi.  Her children are vibrant and active, participating in a slew of activities including dance, basketball and Girl Scouts of America all while maintaining high grades and honor roll status. Her oldest, Kanii will be graduating with an engineering degree in Spring 2019.

She is an active leader in her local congregation and often participates in their community outreach projects.  Shawina is a graduate of St. Joseph’s College and is a Certified Professional Life Coach. She is currently working for administration in the medical field and is pursuing her masters. Shawina took a leap of faith and launched her own non- profit organization called Bleeding Hearts Inc., as the founder and CEO of her own organization she looks ahead to service an even greater span of her fellow citizens in the communities of the world. With the support of her family, friends, and church community Shawina is spearheading her first community event sponsored by Bleeding Hearts Inc.

						Shawina Hunte is an innovative and creative thinker continuously looking for new ways to service people from all walks of life. She can look at the ordinary and see the extraordinary; armed with her favorite quote from famed author Norman Vincent Peale “What the mind can conceive and believe, and the heart desire, you can achieve.”  The possibilities that Shawina can accomplish are endless.
